# Getting Started

## What you need to run the project.
1. You'll need `node`, `npm` and `yarn`  installed on your development toolbox. Ensure following versions:
```text
node 8.9.1
npm 5.5.1
yarn 1.3.2
```
1. You will need AEM 6.3 running locally.

## About project set-up

This project needs you to have AEM running locally. When you run the frontend code locally, it will copy the frontend assets (JS/CSS/static files like fonts, images, etc.) to the right clientlibs folder and then sycn them with locally running AEM server.

For building on a build server, you don't need a local AEM server.
