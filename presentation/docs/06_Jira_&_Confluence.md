## Notes for developers on Jira/Sprint

1. Team is running Sprints of two weeks.
1. Use the [Sprint Board](https://tools.publicis.sapient.com/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=10961) to relay progress on your stories
1. Each work item we pick is set-up as an Epic in Jira.
1. Under each Epic you will find stories assigned to developers or arch (for example, *Coding* or *Code Review* story)
1. Log your time spent daily to Jira and keep your stories up-to-date.
1. Use the Sprint Board to move stories to right swim lanes.
1. When you're done with assigned work move the work item to 'Done' lane.
1. When you're waiting for a dependency to be resolved, open a 'Dependency' and assign it to the right person. Also, move your *Coding* story to Blocked lane.
1. When dependency is resolved, close the Dependency in Jira and move your *Coding* story to in-progress.
1. Keep the 'Remaining time' on your *Coding* story up-to-date so it reflects the actual hours remaining.
