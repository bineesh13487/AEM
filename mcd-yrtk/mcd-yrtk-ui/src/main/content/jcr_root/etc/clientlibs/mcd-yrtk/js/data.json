If you think about the ingredients of our beef burgers, for example, you will find 100% pure and Halal beef patties, farm-fresh tomatoes, lettuce and onions and high-quality buns sourced from our approved bakery.

If we take one or more of these elements away, then microbes cannot grow or spoil the food. McDonald&#39;s food generally has less humidity (or water) content, due to the fact that our patties are grilled on a double-sided hotplate, which extracts most of their humidity in the form of vapor; and our buns are toasted, thus losing significant amounts of their humidity, too.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, McDonald&#39;s food would decay, but it could be in the form of drying rather than rotting unless the cooked food&#39;s humidity is maintained by wrapping the food with cling foil or storing it in a high humidity environment.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Here are some experiments that have been done that explain the science related to this topic:<a href=\"http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/11/the-burger-lab-revisiting-the-myth-of-the-12-year-old-burger-testing-results.html\">http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/11/the-burger-lab-revisiting-the-myth-of-the-12-year-old-burger-testing-results.html<\/a>and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gidsNjq0icw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gidsNjq0icw&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Hope this information is helpful and thank you for your question!&nbsp;<\/p>","type":"Image","country":"ua","alternateDescription":"In McDonald's food is just like the food you prepare at home","categoryName":"Practices","videourl":"","hasVideo":"false","alternateUrl":"https://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/uae/en/your-right-to-know.html/9545/","page":2,"shortUrl":"https://goo.gl/jHFNgA","answerId":22414,"question":"I heard your food never spoils or get bad is this true?","language":"en","user":[{"avatar_url":"http://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/content/dam/Arabia/Arabia/avatar_48x48.jpg","profile_url":"Firas","location":"","name":"Firas","hasAvtar":"true"}],"thumbnailimage":""},{"alternateTitle":"why your fries is tast","tags":["mcdonalds","practices","worldfamousfries"],"hasPicture":"true","heroimage":"/content/dam/Arabia/YRTK_images/yrtk/mcdonalds-journey-of-our-famouse-golden-fries.jpg","questionId":9528,"stats":[{"heatScore":573,"heatRank":643,"viewsToday":945,"viewsTotal":289,"hotness":15,"sharesToday":68,"sharesTotal":74}],"submitdate":"Tue 12/04/2016 05:28:38 PM","categoryId":41,"answer":"<p>We are heartened to know you are a fan of our World Famous Fries, Amna!<\/p><p>We use high quality 100% natural potatoes grown by our approved suppliers who adhere to our strict food quality and safety standards and Halal practices.

This approach allows us to strike the perfect balance of exceptional food quality and quick service. It&#39;s important to note that foods that are kept warm all have their own maximum holding time and are discarded if they are not served within that time. As for hygiene, we take food safety and quality seriously at McDonald&#39;s, and this includes the cleanliness of our kitchens. It&#39;s a continual process of keeping the restaurant clean,&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;or exceeding&nbsp;local health standards. We have a three-step process for washing all of our food-preparation equipment and utensils wash, rinse and sanitize, followed by air-drying. We also keep sanitized cloths on-hand in our kitchens.

If you think about the ingredients of our beef burgers for example, you will find 100% pure and Halal beef patties, farm-fresh tomatoes, lettuce and onions and high quality buns sourced from our approved bakery. Therefore, our food will also decay or rot when left for sometime in an environment that supports the rotting process.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, there is something important to note about the process. Essentially, the microbes that cause rotting are a lot like us, in that they need water, nutrients, warmth and time to grow. If we take one or more of these elements away, then microbes cannot grow or spoil the food. McDonald&#39;s food generally has less humidity (or water) content, due to the fact that our patties are grilled on a double-sided hotplate, which extracts most of their humidity in the form of vapor; and our buns are toasted, thus losing significant amounts of their humidity, too.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, McDonald&#39;s food would decay, but it could be in the form of drying rather than rotting, unless the cooked food&#39;s humidity is maintained by wrapping the food with cling foil or storing it in a high humidity environment.&nbsp;<\/p><p>We hope this thorough response addresses your&nbsp;question well, and thanks for visiting!<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","type":"Text","country":"ua","categoryName":"Practices","videourl":"","hasVideo":"false","alternateUrl":"https://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/uae/en/your-right-to-know.html/1681","page":8,"shortUrl":"http://goo.gl/sDYzzX","answerId":1792,"question":"Is it true that your food does not decay","language":"en","user":[{"avatar_url":"http://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/content/dam/Arabia/Arabia/avatar_48x48.jpg","profile_url":"Ahmad","location":"","name":"Ahmad","hasAvtar":"true"}],"thumbnailimage":""},{"tags":["McDonald's"],"hasPicture":"false","heroimage":"","questionId":1644,"stats":[{"heatScore":378,"heatRank":893,"viewsToday":269,"viewsTotal":191,"hotness":7,"sharesToday":351,"sharesTotal":366}],"submitdate":"Wed 22/04/2015 05:52:52 PM","categoryId":41,"answer":"<p>Hello Rami!
